## Introduction
Welcome to the Floating Blood Donation System Backend repository! This Django-based backend is designed to support our blood donation organization's efforts. It provides essential features for managing donors, recipients, blood types, and appointments. This document will guide you through setting up and using the backend.

## Features
   * User Management: Registration, login, and profile management for donors, recipients, and administrators.
   * Donor Information: Collect and manage information about donors, including blood type and medical history.
   * Recipient Management: Track recipients in need of blood and manage their appointments.
   * Appointment Scheduling: Allow users to schedule appointments for blood donations.
   * Blood Type Matching: Find donors with compatible blood types for recipients.

   * Code editor (Visual studio code recommended) 
   * Python (3.1 +)
   * Django (3.6 +)
   * Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
   * Other dependencies can be found in the requirements.txt file.

## Configuration
I havent done any configurations yet.
 * Use `admin` and `#Dot9047` for username and password

## Usage 
1. Access the Django admin panel by visiting http://localhost:8000/admin/ the superuser account created earlier.
2. Use the admin panel to manage users, donors, recipients, appointments, and other data.
3. To interact with the API, explore the available endpoints (documented below) or use tools like Postman.

No API endpoints so far. But will be developed soon
